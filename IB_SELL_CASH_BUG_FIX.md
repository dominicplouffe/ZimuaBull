# IB SELL Order Cash Balance Bug - Investigation & Fix

## Problem
When Interactive Brokers SELL orders were filled, the portfolio cash balance was NOT being updated, even though:
- SELL transactions were being created correctly
- Holdings were being updated correctly
- The transaction logic appeared correct

## Investigation

### Symptoms
- Portfolio cash balance: `$5,603.61`
- Expected cash (from all transactions): `$5,946.60`
- **Discrepancy: `$342.99`** (missing from 10+ SELL orders)

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in [zimuabull/tasks/ib_order_monitor.py:233-244](zimuabull/tasks/ib_order_monitor.py#L233-L244):

```python
else:  # SELL
    # For SELL orders: Let transaction.save() add cash as normal
    txn = PortfolioTransaction(
        portfolio=order.portfolio,  # ⚠️  Using potentially stale portfolio reference
        symbol=order.symbol,
        transaction_type=TransactionType.SELL,
        quantity=order.filled_quantity,
        price=order.filled_price,
        transaction_date=timezone.now().date(),
        notes=f"IB Order {order.ib_order_id}: {order.client_order_id}",
    )
    txn.save()  # ❌ This should update cash, but doesn't!
```

#### Why it failed:

1. **Stale Portfolio Object**: Inside the `transaction.atomic()` block, `order.portfolio` is a cached Django ORM object that may have stale data
2. **Inconsistent Pattern**: BUY orders manually updated cash (lines 210-211), but SELL orders relied on `PortfolioTransaction.save()` to do it
3. **Silent Failure**: The `save()` method DID execute, transactions WERE created, but the cash update wasn't persisting correctly due to the stale portfolio reference

#### Proof:

Manual testing showed that calling `PortfolioTransaction.save()` directly DOES update cash:

```python
# This works fine when portfolio is fresh:
txn = PortfolioTransaction(...)
txn.save()  # ✅ Cash IS updated

# But inside the atomic block with a cached order.portfolio:
txn = PortfolioTransaction(portfolio=order.portfolio, ...)
txn.save()  # ❌ Cash update doesn't persist
```

## Solution

Changed SELL order handling to match the BUY order pattern:

### Before (Broken):
```python
else:  # SELL
    txn = PortfolioTransaction(
        portfolio=order.portfolio,  # Stale reference
        ...
    )
    txn.save()  # Relies on save() to update cash
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
else:  # SELL
    # Manually add cash (same pattern as BUY orders)
    sell_proceeds = order.filled_quantity * order.filled_price

    order.portfolio.refresh_from_db()  # ✅ Get fresh data
    order.portfolio.cash_balance += sell_proceeds
    order.portfolio.save(update_fields=["cash_balance", "updated_at"])

    logger.info(f"SELL cash added: ${sell_proceeds}")

    # Create transaction WITHOUT cash update (use super().save())
    txn = PortfolioTransaction(...)
    super(PortfolioTransaction, txn).save()  # ✅ Skip cash update
    txn._update_holding_for_sell()  # ✅ Still update holdings
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Code ([ib_order_monitor.py:233-260](zimuabull/tasks/ib_order_monitor.py#L233-L260))

- Added `order.portfolio.refresh_from_db()` to ensure fresh data
- Manually calculate and add `sell_proceeds` to cash balance
- Use `super().save()` to bypass `PortfolioTransaction.save()` cash logic
- Manually call `_update_holding_for_sell()` to update holdings
- Added logging for cash additions

### 2. Fixed Existing Discrepancy

Ran `fix_cash_discrepancy.py` to correct the portfolio's cash balance:
- Recalculated correct balance from all transactions
- Updated portfolio cash from `$5,603.61` → `$5,946.60`
- Restored missing `$342.99` from unfulfilled SELL orders

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Check Current Balance**:
   ```bash
   python check_cash_discrepancy.py
   ```
   Should show no discrepancy.

2. **Test with New SELL Order**:
   - Wait for next IB SELL order to fill
   - Check logs for "SELL cash added" message
   - Verify cash balance increases correctly

3. **Monitor Going Forward**:
   ```bash
   python diagnose_sell_cash.py
   ```
   Should show cash properly updated for all future SELL orders.

## Prevention

### Code Pattern to Follow:

For ALL IB order processing, use this pattern:

```python
# 1. Refresh portfolio to avoid stale data
order.portfolio.refresh_from_db()

# 2. Manually update cash
order.portfolio.cash_balance += amount  # or -= for buys
order.portfolio.save(update_fields=["cash_balance", "updated_at"])

# 3. Create transaction WITHOUT cash update
txn = PortfolioTransaction(...)
super(PortfolioTransaction, txn).save()

# 4. Manually update holdings
txn._update_holding_for_buy()  # or _update_holding_for_sell()
```

### Why This Pattern?

1. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Cash updates are visible in the code
2. **Avoids stale data**: `refresh_from_db()` ensures fresh data
3. **Consistent**: BUY and SELL use the same pattern
4. **Auditable**: Logging shows exactly when cash was updated
5. **Debuggable**: If cash isn't updating, you can see exactly where it should be

Fix: IB SELL orders now properly update portfolio cash balance

The issue was that SELL order handling relied on PortfolioTransaction.save()
to update cash, but was using a potentially stale portfolio reference from
order.portfolio inside the transaction.atomic() block.

Changed to match BUY order pattern:
- Explicitly refresh_from_db() before updating cash
- Manually add sell proceeds to portfolio.cash_balance
- Use super().save() to bypass automatic cash update
- Manually call _update_holding_for_sell()

Also fixed existing $342.99 discrepancy from previous unfulfilled SELL orders.

Closes: IB SELL cash balance bug
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Ready to commit and deploy

The fix has been applied to [ib_order_monitor.py](zimuabull/tasks/ib_order_monitor.py) and the existing cash discrepancy has been corrected.
