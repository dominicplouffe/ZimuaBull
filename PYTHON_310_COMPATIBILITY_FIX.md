# Python 3.10 Compatibility Fix

## Issue

The server was failing with this error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'UTC' from 'datetime' (/usr/local/lib/python3.10/datetime.py)
```

## Root Cause

The `datetime.UTC` constant was added in **Python 3.11**, but the Docker container runs **Python 3.10**.

The code was using:
```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime, timedelta
dt = datetime.now(tz=UTC).date()
```

## Fix Applied

Changed to use `timezone.utc` which is available in Python 3.2+:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
dt = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc).date()
```

**File Modified:** `zimuabull/scanners/tse.py`

## Additional Fix

Updated `requirements.docker` to match the local httpx version:
- Changed `httpx==0.27.0` → `httpx==0.27.2`

This ensures consistency between local and Docker environments for OpenAI SDK compatibility.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Rebuild Docker images:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Restart containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Celery starts without errors:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f celery
   ```

## Recommendation: Upgrade to Python 3.11+

While the fix ensures Python 3.10 compatibility, consider upgrading to Python 3.11 or 3.12 for:
- Better performance (10-60% faster)
- Better error messages
- Native UTC support
- Security updates

**To upgrade, change `Dockerfile` line 2:**
```dockerfile
# From:
FROM python:3.10-slim

# To:
FROM python:3.12-slim
```

Then rebuild the Docker image.

## Compatibility

The fix is **backwards and forwards compatible**:
- ✅ Works on Python 3.2+
- ✅ Works on Python 3.10 (Docker)
- ✅ Works on Python 3.11+
- ✅ Works on Python 3.13 (local dev)

## Testing

Verified that `timezone.utc` works correctly:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
dt = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc).date()
print(dt)  # 2025-10-11
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
